owner that is granting the License.

"Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all other entities
that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that entity.
For the purposes of this definition, "control" means (i) the power, direct or
indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by
contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

"You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity exercising permissions
granted by this License.

"Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications, including
but not limited to software source code, documentation source, and configuration
files.

"Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical transformation or
translation of a Source form, including but not limited to compiled object code,
generated documentation, and conversions to other media types.

"Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or Object form, made
available under the License, as indicated by a copyright notice that is included
in or attached to the work (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

"Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that is
based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions,
annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an
original work of authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works
shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by
name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

"Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version
of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works
thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by
the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on
behalf of the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the
Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on
electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems
that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for the purpose of discussing
and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked
or otherwise designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a
Contribution."

"Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf of
whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently incorporated
within the Work.

2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide,
non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to
reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object
form.

3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive,
no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent
license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise
transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims
licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to
which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation
against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)
alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes
direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to
You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such
litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or
Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in
Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

  a. You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of
    this License; and

  b. You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that
    You changed the files; and

  c. You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You
    distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from
    the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to
    any part of the Derivative Works; and

  d. If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then
    any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the
    attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those
    notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least
    one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of
    the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided
    along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the
    Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear.
    The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do
    not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within
    Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the
    NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices
    cannot be construed as modifying the License.

You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide
additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or
distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole,
provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies
with the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any
Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the
Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any
additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall
supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have
executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names,
trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required
for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and
reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in
writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its
Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND,
either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or
conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks
associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in
tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by
applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in
writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any
direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character
arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage,
computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or
losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such
damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or
Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for,
acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or
rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You
may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of
any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each
Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against,
such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional
liability.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

MICROSOFT SOFTWARE LICENSE TERMS
MICROSOFT .NET LIBRARY
================================

These license terms are an agreement between Microsoft Corporation (or based on
where you live, one of its affiliates) and you. Please read them. They apply to
the software named above, which includes the media on which you received it, if
any. The terms also apply to any Microsoft

  *  updates,

  *  supplements,

  *  Internet-based services, and

  *  support services

for this software, unless other terms accompany those items. If so, those terms
apply.

BY USING THE SOFTWARE, YOU ACCEPT THESE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THEM, DO NOT
USE THE SOFTWARE.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IF YOU COMPLY WITH THESE LICENSE TERMS, YOU HAVE THE PERPETUAL RIGHTS BELOW.

  1. INSTALLATION AND USE RIGHTS.

      a. Installation and Use.  You may install and use any number of copies of
        the software to design, develop and test your programs. You may modify,
        copy, distribute or deploy any .js files contained in the software as
        part of your programs.

      b. Third Party Programs.  The software may include third party programs
        that Microsoft, not the third party, licenses to you under this
        agreement. Notices, if any, for the third party program are included for
        your information only.

  2. ADDITIONAL LICENSING REQUIREMENTS AND/OR USE RIGHTS.

      a. DISTRIBUTABLE CODE.  In addition to the .js files described above, the
        software is comprised of Distributable Code. "Distributable Code" is code
        that you are permitted to distribute in programs you develop if you
        comply with the terms below.

          i. Right to Use and Distribute.

              *  You may copy and distribute the object code form of the
                software.

              *  Third Party Distribution. You may permit distributors of your
                programs to copy and distribute the Distributable Code as part of
                those programs.

      b. Distribution Requirements.  For any Distributable Code you distribute,
        you must

          *  use the Distributable Code in your programs and not as a standalone
            distribution;

          *  require distributors and external end users to agree to terms that
            protect it at least as much as this agreement;

          *  display your valid copyright notice on your programs; and

          * indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Microsoft from any claims,
            including attorneys' fees, related to the distribution or use of your
            programs.

      c. Distribution Restrictions.  You may not

          *  alter any copyright, trademark or patent notice in the Distributable
            Code;

          * use Microsoft's trademarks in your programs' names or in a way that
            suggests your programs come from or are endorsed by Microsoft;

          *  include Distributable Code in malicious, deceptive or unlawful
            programs; or

          *  modify or distribute the source code of any Distributable Code so
            that any part of it becomes subject to an Excluded License. An
            Excluded License is one that requires, as a condition of use,
            modification or distribution, that

              *  the code be disclosed or distributed in source code form; or

              *  others have the right to modify it.

  * SCOPE OF LICENSE.  The software is licensed, not sold. This agreement only
    gives you some rights to use the software. Microsoft reserves all other
    rights. Unless applicable law gives you more rights despite this limitation,
    you may use the software only as expressly permitted in this agreement. In
    doing so, you must comply with any technical limitations in the software that
    only allow you to use it in certain ways. You may not

      *  work around any technical limitations in the software;

      * reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the software, except and only
        to the extent that applicable law expressly permits, despite this
        limitation;

      *  publish the software for others to copy;

      *  rent, lease or lend the software; or

      *  transfer the software or this agreement to any third party.

  * BACKUP COPY.  You may make one backup copy of the software. You may use it
    only to reinstall the software.

  * DOCUMENTATION.  Any person that has valid access to your computer or internal
    network may copy and use the documentation for your internal, reference
    purposes.

  * EXPORT RESTRICTIONS.  The software is subject to United States export laws
    and regulations. You must comply with all domestic and international export
    laws and regulations that apply to the software. These laws include
    restrictions on destinations, end users and end use. For additional
    information, see www.microsoft.com/exporting

  * SUPPORT SERVICES.  Because this software is "as is," we may not provide
    support services for it.

  * ENTIRE AGREEMENT.  This agreement, and the terms for supplements, updates,
    Internet-based services and support services that you use, are the entire
    agreement for the software and support services.

  * APPLICABLE LAW.

      a. United States.  If you acquired the software in the United States,
        Washington state law governs the interpretation of this agreement and
        applies to claims for breach of it, regardless of conflict of laws
        principles. The laws of the state where you live govern all other claims,
        including claims under state consumer protection laws, unfair competition
        laws, and in tort.

      b. Outside the United States.  If you acquired the software in any other
        country, the laws of that country apply.

  * LEGAL EFFECT.  This agreement describes certain legal rights. You may have
    other rights under the laws of your country. You may also have rights with
    respect to the party from whom you acquired the software. This agreement does
    not change your rights under the laws of your country if the laws of your
    country do not permit it to do so.

  * DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.  THE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED "AS-IS." YOU BEAR THE RISK
    OF USING IT. MICROSOFT GIVES NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES OR CONDITIONS.
    YOU MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL CONSUMER RIGHTS OR STATUTORY GUARANTEES UNDER YOUR
    LOCAL LAWS WHICH THIS AGREEMENT CANNOT CHANGE. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER
    YOUR LOCAL LAWS, MICROSOFT EXCLUDES THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
    MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

    FOR AUSTRALIA – YOU HAVE STATUTORY GUARANTEES UNDER THE AUSTRALIAN CONSUMER
    LAW AND NOTHING IN THESE TERMS IS INTENDED TO AFFECT THOSE RIGHTS.

  *  LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF REMEDIES AND DAMAGES.  YOU CAN RECOVER FROM
    MICROSOFT AND ITS SUPPLIERS ONLY DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO U.S. $5.00. YOU CANNOT
    RECOVER ANY OTHER DAMAGES, INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL, LOST PROFITS, SPECIAL,
    INDIRECT OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES.

    This limitation applies to

      *  anything related to the software, services, content (including code) on
        third party Internet sites, or third party programs; and

      * claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty, guarantee or
        condition, strict liability, negligence, or other tort to the extent
        permitted by applicable law.

    It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the
    possibility of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion may not apply
    to you because your country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of
    incidental, consequential or other damages. Please note: As this software is
    distributed in Quebec, Canada, some of the clauses in this agreement are
    provided below in French.

    Remarque : Ce logiciel étant distribué au Québec, Canada, certaines des
    clauses dans ce contrat sont fournies ci-dessous en français.

    EXONÉRATION DE GARANTIE.  Le logiciel visé par une licence est offert « tel
    quel ». Toute utilisation de ce logiciel est à votre seule risque et péril.
    Microsoft n'accorde aucune autre garantie expresse. Vous pouvez bénéficier de
    droits additionnels en vertu du droit local sur la protection des
    consommateurs, que ce contrat ne peut modifier. La ou elles sont permises par
    le droit locale, les garanties implicites de qualité marchande, d'adéquation
    à un usage particulier et d'absence de contrefaçon sont exclues.

    LIMITATION DES DOMMAGES-INTÉRÊTS ET EXCLUSION DE RESPONSABILITÉ POUR LES
    DOMMAGES.  Vous pouvez obtenir de Microsoft et de ses fournisseurs une
    indemnisation en cas de dommages directs uniquement à hauteur de 5,00 $ US.
    Vous ne pouvez prétendre àaucune indemnisation pour les autres dommages, y
    compris les dommages spéciaux, indirects ou accessoires et pertes de
    bénéfices.

    Cette limitation concerne :

      *  tout ce qui est relié au logiciel, aux services ou au contenu (y compris
        le code) figurant sur des sites Internet tiers ou dans des programmes
        tiers ; et

      *  les réclamations au titre de violation de contrat ou de garantie, ou au
        titre de responsabilité stricte, de négligence ou d'une autre faute dans
        la limite autorisée par la loi en vigueur.

    Elle s'applique également, même si Microsoft connaissait ou devrait connaître
    l'éventualité d'un tel dommage. Si votre pays n'autorise pas l'exclusion ou
    la limitation de responsabilité pour les dommages indirects, accessoires ou
    de quelque nature que ce soit, il se peut que la limitation ou l'exclusion
    ci-dessus ne s'appliquera pas à votre égard.

    EFFET JURIDIQUE.  Le présent contrat décrit certains droits juridiques. Vous
    pourriez avoir d'autres droits prévus par les lois de votre pays. Le présent
    contrat ne modifie pas les droits que vous confèrent les lois de votre pays
    si celles-ci ne le permettent pas.
